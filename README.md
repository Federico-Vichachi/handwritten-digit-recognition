# Handwritten Digit Recognition with CNN

## Description
This project is a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model that recognizes handwritten digits. The model is integrated into a web application where there is a space to draw, and it returns the number that the model recognizes. This is my first completed project that I am uploading to GitHub, and I am very excited about it!

## Inspiration
The model was created inspired by a video from the YouTuber Rigatech, from whom I learned a lot as I participated in a course in which he was the professor.

## Requirements
This project requires the following Python libraries:
- TensorFlow
- Matplotlib
- NumPy

## Model Training and Exporting
Although I was able to train and save the model, I had problems exporting it for use on the web from VSCode because I had problems with TensorFlow.js. I was able to do it from Google Colab.

## Model Performance
The model has a 90% effectiveness (training of 150 epochs). It has problems distinguishing between a 1 and a 7.
